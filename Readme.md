This repository contains the definitions for the Mostly Harmless AI challenges.
Each challenge~(alternatively called a "task" hereafter) is defined by a Readme file, a grading script, and potentially some additional data files (public and private) and baseline scripts.
Challenges are stored in the `tasks` folder.
